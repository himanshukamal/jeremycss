    <p>Lets say you have a product, a portfolio, or just an idea you want to share with everyone on your own website. Before you publish it on the internet, you want to make it look attractive, professional, or at least decent to look at. What is the first thing you need to work on?</p>
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>The purpose of design is to enhance the presentation of the content it's applied to. It might sound obvious, but content being the primary element of a website, it should not be established as an afterthought.</p>

    <p>Written content, like the paragraph you're currently reading, makes up for more than 90% of the Web. Styling this textual content will go a long way.</p>

    <p>Let's assume you've already finalised the content you want to publish and just created an empty style.css file, what is the first rule you can write?</p>
<h2>Centering</h2>
<p>Long lines of text can be hard to parse, and thus hard to read. Setting a limit of characters per line enhances the readability and appeal of a wall of text.</p>
<code><pre>
    body {
    margin:0 auto;
    max-width: 50em;
}
